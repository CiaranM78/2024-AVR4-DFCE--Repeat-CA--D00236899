  Description: ' My superiors assigned me to a project to deconstruct the space vessel
    to see how it operates and to see what we could reverse engineer from the technology,
    me personally I would rather repair the vessel and fly off on it . If your one
    of the new employees here the door code is located in a bush near the facility.'
